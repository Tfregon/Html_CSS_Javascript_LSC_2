This workspace outlines the content and exercises covered in my Web Development course. It includes fundamental concepts and practical examples for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Browser Storage. Each chapter explores specific topics and provides hands-on tasks such as building Task Manager applications, using forms and AJAX, and incorporating libraries like Bootstrap and Sweet Alert. The course culminates with evaluations, including mock exams and a final project that integrates all learned concepts.
